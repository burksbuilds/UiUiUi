/** Main abstraction of a group of interface widgets.
 *
 * A widget group organizes a number of widgets in a certain way.
 * These organized widgets form a linked list via their "next" pointers.
 * The widget group gets the first of these widgets as their "first widget".
 *
 * As a widget group itself is also a widget, it has itself potentially a successor
 * which allows forming another widget group on a "higher level".
 *
 * Widget groups are the key to create complex interfaces with UiUiUi.
 * Be sure to understand the concept behind them.
 *
 * As with the UIWidget class, UIWidgetGroup itself only implements a tiny portion
 * of the business logic. The derived classes actually create a semantic onto the
 * grouped widgets, e.g. aligning them horizontally or vertically.
