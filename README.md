# UiUiUi user interface library

The UiUiUi user interface library allows designing user interfaces on typical tiny displays for micro controllers. It handles arranging and layouting of the interface elements and updating according portions of the display if an UI element changes its content. The interface is defined fully static; everything is done in the data segment of the program, no heap space and dynamic memory allocation is needed.

More information is to come.
